# Tag Taxonomy

Recommended tags for consistent cross-domain tagging. Tags are lowercase, singular form.

## Domain Tags

| Tag | When to Use |
|-----|-------------|
| `business` | Business planning, strategy, agency work |
| `homelab` | Infrastructure, self-hosting, kubernetes |
| `programming` | General programming concepts |
| `personal` | Lifestyle, recipes, fitness, travel |
| `work` | Employment-related notes |
| `reading` | Book notes, article summaries |

## Technical Tags

| Tag | When to Use |
|-----|-------------|
| `fp` | Functional programming concepts |
| `ddd` | Domain-driven design |
| `nix` | NixOS, Nix flakes, home-manager |
| `haskell` | Haskell language |
| `scala` | Scala/ZIO |
| `react` | React/frontend |
| `k8s` | Kubernetes, containers |
| `seo` | Search engine optimization |
| `ai` | AI/ML, chatbots, LLMs |
| `security` | Security, auth, networking |

## Methodology Tags

| Tag | When to Use |
|-----|-------------|
| `pattern` | Design patterns, architectural patterns |
| `tutorial` | Step-by-step guides |
| `reference` | Quick-reference material |
| `research` | Market research, analysis |
| `plan` | Plans, strategies, roadmaps |
| `snippet` | Code snippets, quick recipes |

## Special Tags

| Tag | When to Use |
|-----|-------------|
| `moc` | Maps of Content only |
| `archive` | Archived/legacy content |
| `fleeting` | Unprocessed capture notes (should be refined) |

## Tagging Rules

1. Use 2-4 tags per note (not too many, not too few)
2. Always include at least one domain tag
3. Add technical tags when the note is about a specific technology
4. Use `fleeting` for quick captures that need refinement
5. Never tag with folder names redundantly (e.g., don't tag `homelab` on notes already in `homelab/` unless it cross-references another domain)
