# CTA Optimization

## Visual Design

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| **Contrast** | Most prominent element on page; stands out from background |
| **Size** | Large enough to tap (min 44px height), not overwhelming |
| **White space** | Isolate with generous padding (232% conversion boost) |
| **Shape** | Rounded corners feel friendlier; sharp corners feel urgent |
| **Shadow/depth** | Subtle elevation makes it feel clickable |

## Placement

| Location | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Above fold** | Quick conversions, clear value prop |
| **End of content** | After building case, addressing objections |
| **Sticky footer** | Mobile, long pages, e-commerce |
| **Multiple CTAs** | Long pages - repeat primary CTA strategically |

## Copy Patterns That Convert

### First-Person Outperforms Second-Person (90% lift)
- "Start my free trial" > "Start your free trial"
- "Get my report" > "Get your report"
- "Create my account" > "Create account"

### Action Verb + Benefit
- "Get instant access"
- "Reserve my spot"
- "Download the guide"
- "See pricing"

### Avoid Generic Labels
| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| Submit | Create my account |
| Click here | Download the guide |
| Next | See my results |
| Continue | Start my free trial |

## Urgency & Scarcity (Use Authentically)

- "Only 3 spots left" (if true)
- "Offer ends midnight" (if true)
- "Join 10,000+ members" (social proof)
- Fake urgency destroys trust

## CTA Hierarchy

When multiple CTAs exist:

```
Primary: High contrast, prominent
  "Start free trial"

Secondary: Outlined/ghost style
  "See demo"

Tertiary: Text link
  "Learn more"
```

## Personalization

Personalized CTAs convert 202% better:
- Returning visitor: "Welcome back - continue where you left off"
- By segment: "Plans for teams" vs "Plans for freelancers"
- By funnel stage: "Get started" (top) vs "Buy now" (bottom)
