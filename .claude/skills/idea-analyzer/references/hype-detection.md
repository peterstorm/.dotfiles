# Hype & Affiliate Marketing Detection Patterns

## Red Flags — Source Credibility

### 🚩 Financial Claims Without Proof
- "I made $X in Y days/months" without showing actual dashboards, tax returns, or verifiable data
- Revenue screenshots (easily faked) presented as proof
- "Passive income" framing — almost nothing is truly passive
- Conflating revenue with profit — $100K revenue with $95K costs is not impressive

### 🚩 Affiliate / Referral Incentives
- Links to specific tools with referral codes or UTM parameters (`?ref=`, `?via=`, affiliate subdomain patterns)
- Suspiciously specific tool recommendations without mentioning alternatives
- "Use my link for a discount" — they're being paid to recommend this
- Comparison posts where one option conveniently "wins" (and has the affiliate link)

### 🚩 Info-Product Ecosystem
- The person selling a course/ebook/community about the exact thing they're teaching
- "Join my mastermind/community" upsell
- Free content that's actually a sales funnel for paid content
- Testimonials from students that are suspiciously polished or same-format
- "DM me for details" → they're selling coaching

### 🚩 Survivorship Bias Signals
- Only success stories, no failures or challenges mentioned
- "If I can do it, anyone can" — classic survivorship framing
- Before/after narratives without context of timeline, prior experience, existing audience
- Cherry-picked case studies (showing 3 successes from 3,000 attempts)

### 🚩 Urgency & Scarcity Manipulation
- "This opportunity won't last" / "Get in before it's too late"
- "The market is about to explode" without credible market data
- Artificial scarcity of information (the idea itself is freely available)
- FOMO-driven framing — positioning viewers as missing out

### 🚩 Vague Execution Details
- Heavy on the "what" and "why", light on the "how"
- "Just build an AI wrapper" without addressing competition, distribution, retention
- No mention of: customer acquisition cost, churn, support burden, technical complexity
- "It's simple" / "Anyone can do this" — dismisses real execution challenges

### 🚩 Guru / Thought Leader Patterns
- Personal brand more prominent than actual business results
- Speaking circuit / conference presence as primary credibility (not building things)
- Content optimized for engagement, not accuracy
- Contrarian takes for attention rather than insight
- Followers/subscribers as credibility proxy (audience ≠ expertise)

## Green Flags — Source Credibility

### ✅ Transparent & Specific
- Shows actual numbers with context (costs, timeline, failures along the way)
- Mentions what went wrong and what they'd do differently
- Acknowledges luck, timing, or unfair advantages they had
- Links to verifiable evidence (public repos, live products, press coverage)

### ✅ Practitioner, Not Promoter
- Person is actively building/running the thing they're talking about
- Revenue comes from the business itself, not from teaching about it
- Shares operational details that only someone doing it would know
- Engages with edge cases and complications honestly

### ✅ Balanced Perspective
- Mentions competitors and alternative approaches fairly
- Discusses who this is NOT for
- Acknowledges market risks and potential downturn scenarios
- Provides nuanced view rather than binary "do this = success"

### ✅ Domain Expertise Signals
- Technical depth that goes beyond surface-level
- Specific industry knowledge (regulations, market dynamics, buyer behavior)
- Historical context — understands market cycles, not just current hype
- Network/reputation that can be independently verified
