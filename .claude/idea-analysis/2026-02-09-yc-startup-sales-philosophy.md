# YC Sales Philosophy for Startups

## TL;DR

Framework: startup sales = problem solving, not persuasion. Stay founder-led, don't outsource early, embrace "consulting-like" deep work as a moat.

## Scores

- **Idea Viability** — Strong. Proven sales philosophy validated by every successful B2B company.
- **Hype/BS** — Low risk. YC managing directors, verifiable track records, no affiliate incentives, balanced perspective.
- **dotslash.dev Fit** — Strong (both segments). Maps directly onto "we'll tell you when NOT to use AI" positioning + Copenhagen SMB high-touch sales.
- **Effort vs Payoff** — High. Zero build effort, pure mental model shift, immediately applicable.

## Key Takeaways

1. Good sales is invisible — feels like someone understanding your problem and helping, not being sold to.
2. Discounting a product the customer doesn't want makes it worse. If they don't see value, price is irrelevant.
3. Actually empathize: imagine you're their CEO. Know their top 3 problems. Know if your product solves any.
4. Can't outsource sales by hiring VP Sales — enterprise skills from big cos don't transfer to early startups.
5. Successful enterprise cos (Palantir) have deep founder/CEO involvement in sales — org multiplies founder work, doesn't replace it.
6. "That's consulting" is overused. Deep integrations and long sales cycles are moats, not bugs.
7. Both sides of a deal must end up better — that's real trade.

## Actionable for dotslash.dev

### Pre-call ritual
Before every prospect call, write: "If I were CEO of this company, my top 3 problems would be..." If you can't fill it in, you're not ready.

### Segment B pitch reframe
Don't lead with "AI chatbot" features. Lead with "you're losing 6-18K DKK/month in missed after-hours calls" — solve their problem, don't pitch your product.

### Consulting-as-moat (Segment A) — expanded

The video's core argument: founders over-apply the "that's consulting" label to reject work that would actually teach them the problem space and create switching costs. Dalton's point is that deep integrations and long sales cycles are the *reason* Palantir has no real competition — everyone else shies away from the hard stuff.

**"It takes weeks to understand our system" = moat, not bug.** If a client's RAG pipeline needs 2-3 weeks of discovery before you can rebuild it for production, that's not inefficiency — that's the barrier competitors won't cross. Agencies selling "AI in a day" demos can't touch this work. FP/DDD depth makes the discovery phase something you're uniquely equipped for, and the output (production system with monitoring, guardrails, eval infra) is too integrated to rip out and replace.

**The productization path is real.** "9/10 times what you call consulting can be productized" maps to your trajectory. Each consulting engagement teaches patterns — common RAG failure modes, typical eval gaps, recurring data pipeline shapes. Over time these become repeatable frameworks, reusable components, or Segment B features. The first 5 consulting clients aren't just revenue — they're R&D you're getting paid for.

**Position it explicitly in sales conversations.** "Other vendors will give you a demo in a week. We'll spend two weeks understanding your system first, because the difference between a demo and a production system is whether someone actually understood your problem." The willingness to go deep *is* the pitch.

**The Palantir parallel is instructive but bounded.** Palantir can do this because their margins survive the sales cycle. At solo scale, the risk is spending 3 weeks in unpaid discovery and losing the deal. Mitigation: charge for discovery as a standalone deliverable (the Discovery → Advisory phase already does this). Consulting-as-moat works only if you're getting paid during the moat-building phase.

**Honest tension:** consulting caps your time. The video acknowledges this indirectly — Palantir built an org around the founder to scale. Solo means the moat argument holds for positioning and winning deals, but the productization path (consulting patterns → reusable Segment B assets or packaged offerings) is what scales. The moat buys time and credibility; the flywheel from consulting → product is what makes it sustainable.

### Don't hire sales too early
At pre-20 clients, founder-led sales is correct. A hired salesperson won't know your customers' problems the way you do.
