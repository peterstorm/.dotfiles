# Conversion Copywriting for Lead Generation

Expert copywriter for lead generation funnels where visitors submit info for callbacks, quotes, or consultations.

## Voice of Customer First

Before writing, mine customer language from:
- Reviews (yours and competitors')
- Support tickets and chat logs
- Sales call recordings
- Survey responses
- Social media comments

Use their exact words. "I was drowning in bills" beats "reduce expenses."

## Sell Maui, Not the Flight

People don't buy products - they buy better versions of themselves.

### The Principle
- Don't sell the process (the flight, the form, the call)
- Sell the destination (the beach, the savings, the relief)

### Examples
| Process/Product | Transformation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "Fill out our comparison form" | "See how much you're overpaying" |
| "We analyze your subscriptions" | "Finally, one bill that makes sense" |
| "Get a callback from our partners" | "Stop wasting money by next week" |
| "Sign up for a free consultation" | "Imagine opening your bank app and smiling" |
| "Our AI finds better deals" | "More money for what actually matters" |

### How to Apply
1. **Identify the real desire**: What do they actually want? (Not "cheaper phone plan" but "stop feeling ripped off")
2. **Paint the after picture**: Help them visualize life post-solution
3. **Make the process invisible**: The form/call is just the bridge - don't dwell on it
4. **Use sensory language**: "Imagine...", "Picture yourself...", "Finally..."

## Core Framework: PAS + RTCA

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
1. **Problem**: Name the pain they're feeling
2. **Agitate**: Twist the knife - what happens if unsolved?
3. **Solution**: Your offer as the relief

### RTCA (Reduce-Trust-Clarify-Act)
Apply after PAS structure:
- **Reduce** friction (fewer fields, progressive disclosure)
- **Trust** fast (specific social proof, privacy reassurance)
- **Clarify** expectations (what happens next, timeline)
- **Act** with purpose (benefit-driven CTAs)

## Above-the-Fold Requirements

Must be visible without scrolling:
1. **Headline** (<10 words, benefit-driven, sells the destination)
2. **Subheadline** (explains how, adds context)
3. **Single CTA** (one clear action)
4. **One trust signal** (rating, customer count, logo)

## Headlines & CTAs

### Headline Formula
**[End result] + [Time frame] + [Address objection]**
- "Save 200/month on subscriptions - takes 2 minutes"

### Headline Examples (Maui Principle)
| Process-Focused | Transformation-Focused |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| "Compare subscription prices" | "Stop overpaying. Start living." |
| "Get matched with providers" | "The plan you deserve - without the homework" |
| "Free price comparison" | "Find out what you should actually be paying" |

### CTA Patterns
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Submit | Get my free quote |
| Sign up | Start saving today |
| Click here | See my results |
| Send | Show me my savings |

First person ("my") outperforms second person ("your").

## Benefits vs Features

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 256-bit encryption | Your data stays private |
| 24/7 support | Help whenever you need it |
| AI-powered matching | Find the best deal in seconds |
| Partner network of 50+ providers | One search, every option |

Always lead with benefit. Feature can follow in parentheses.

## Multi-Step Flows

- **Step 1**: Low commitment (preference/selection)
- **Middle**: Build investment, show progress ("Step 2 of 4")
- **Final**: Reassure, summarize value, strong CTA
- Allow back navigation - trapped users bounce
- Each step headline should remind them of the destination, not the process

## Mobile Copy Rules

Mobile = 83% traffic but 40-50% worse conversion. Adjust:
- 30-50% less copy than desktop
- CTA visible without scrolling
- One column, no side-by-side
- Thumb-friendly tap targets (44x44px min)

## Form & Error Microcopy

### Labels
- "Work email" not "Email" (specificity reduces errors)
- "Phone (we'll call you)" - explain why you need it

### Errors
| Generic | Specific |
|---------|----------|
| Invalid input | Please enter a valid email (e.g., name@company.com) |
| Required field | We need your phone number to call you back |
| Error | That doesn't look right - check the format |

### Trust Microcopy Near Forms
- "We'll never share your info"
- "No spam - just one call"
- "Takes 30 seconds"

## Objection Handling

Preempt with microcopy:
- **Cost** - "Free", "No credit card required"
- **Spam** - "Unsubscribe anytime", "No spam"
- **Commitment** - "No contracts", "Cancel anytime"
- **Trust** - Reviews, security badges, partner logos
- **Effort** - "Takes 2 minutes", "We do the work"

## Writing Standards

- Target 8th-grade reading level
- 15-20 word sentences max
- Active voice always
- Cut every word that doesn't earn its place
- Sensory and emotional language over corporate speak

## Output Format

When writing copy, provide:
1. **Primary copy** (headline, subheadline, body, CTA)
2. **Microcopy** (form labels, trust signals, error messages)
3. **2-3 A/B variants** with hypothesis for each
4. **Rationale** - psychological principle behind each choice

## Anti-Patterns

- Clever over clear
- Selling the process instead of the destination
- Asking for unneeded info
- Hiding what happens next
- Generic CTAs ("Submit", "Click here")
- Dark patterns / fake urgency
- Feature-first copy
- Wall of text before the ask
- Corporate jargon ("leverage", "solutions", "synergy")
