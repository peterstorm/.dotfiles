- "No credit card required" under "Start trial" button

### Pricing Pages

- Case study snippets with metrics
- Trust badges for payment security

### Checkout

- Return policy summary
- Support availability
- Order summary with clear pricing

### Throughout Site
- Social proof numbers in header/footer
- Client logos in dedicated section
- Testimonial carousel or wall

### Elements of Strong Testimonials
- Full name and title
- Company name (with permission)
- Photo (real, not stock)
- Specific result/metric
- Relevant to target audience's concerns

## Social Proof Psychology

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Similarity** | Show testimonials from people like your target user |
| **Authority** | Expert endorsements, certifications |
| **Consensus** | "Most popular", "Bestseller" labels |
| **Recency** | Recent reviews more credible; show dates |
| **Specificity** | Specific numbers beat vague claims |

## Trust Signal Hierarchy

```
High Impact:
├── Customer reviews with photos
├── Recognizable client logos
├── Security badges at checkout
└── Money-back guarantee

Medium Impact:
├── User count / social proof numbers
├── Case studies
├── Industry certifications
└── Media mentions ("As seen in...")

Lower Impact (but still useful):
├── Years in business
├── Team photos / About page
└── Physical address
└── Phone number
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Fake reviews (destroys trust if discovered)
- Stock photos for testimonials
- Vague claims without specifics
- Too many badges cluttering the page
- Trust signals hidden in footer only
- Outdated testimonials (show recent ones)
